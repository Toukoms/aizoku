# 🧠 Aizoku — Your Offline AI Companion

**Aizoku** is a local-first AI assistant built for **everyone**.  
It’s privacy-friendly, offline-ready, and model-flexible — powered by [Ollama](https://ollama.com/).

> _"Aizoku" comes from the fusion of "AI" and "Zoku" (族), meaning "clan" or "tribe" in Japanese — because you're never
alone when Aizoku is with you._
